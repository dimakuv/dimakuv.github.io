    <p>Currently, I work at Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Dresden, Germany, with a focus on kernel and OS security.</p>
    <p>From 2020 to 2024, I worked at Intel Labs in Munich, Germany where I focused on software infrastructure for current and future Intel TEEs. In particular, I was one of the maintainers of <a href="https://github.com/gramineproject">the Gramine project</a>, whose SGX backend is used in a variety of confidential computing solutions. I was also the lead developer of Gramine's TDX backend. Additionally, I was the current maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/CCC-Attestation/interoperable-ra-tls">the Interoperable RA-TLS project</a>.</p>
    <p>From 2018 to 2020, I worked at Intel Labs in Hillsboro, OR.</p>
    <p>Prior to joining Intel, I was a PhD student at TU Dresden co-supervised by Prof. Dr. Christof Fetzer and Prof. Dr. Pramod Bhatotia. During my PhD, I interned with Intel Labs (summer 2017). My research focused on dependability of software systems, with emphasis on fault tolerance and security. I defended my PhD thesis titled "Hardware-Assisted Dependable Systems" in early 2018.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Before joining TU Dresden, I worked as a software engineer at Auriga Inc (2010 &mdash; 2011) and Diasoft (2007 &mdash; 2010) in Moscow.</p>
