    <p>I currently work at Intel Labs in Hillsboro, OR.</p>
    <p>Prior to joining Intel, I was a PhD student at TU Dresden co-supervised by Prof. Dr. Christof Fetzer and Prof. Dr. Pramod Bhatotia. During my PhD, I interned with Intel Labs (summer 2017). My research focused on dependability of software systems, with emphasis on fault tolerance and security. I defended my PhD thesis titled "Hardware-Assisted Dependable Systems" in early 2018.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Before joining TU Dresden, I worked as a software engineer at Auriga Inc (2010 &mdash; 2011) and Diasoft (2007 &mdash; 2010) in Moscow.</p>
